"""The vocabulary a lesson module is written in.

A lesson is a dict: slug, title, blurb, objectives (the whole lesson's, for the
hub), and steps - one dict per step, made by step() below. Everything a step
needs to render is in its `data`, in the shape the renderer of that `kind`
consumes (lib/science.js). The builder checks the shapes; this file only makes
them easy to write.

The four-move explainer is the Mathematics build's own: NAME the idea, SHOW it
on this step's content, WARN about the slip children actually make here, HAND
back with one thing to try. Each move is a sibling <mstts:express-as>, never
nested - Azure forbids nesting and the voice walker flattens it.
