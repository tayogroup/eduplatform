### Science answer keys and Cambridge mapping are gated

Two checks inside `check:science`, both added after the Computing course shipped
three keys bound to the wrong option with every gate passing them.

**`check-science-answer-keys.mjs`** compares each quiz key with the answer key
printed in its own booklet. Science is far more exposed than Computing here:
598 of its 636 questions come from the booklet, where Computing generates 580
of 768 from the unit's own content and only 188 can disagree with anything.
Ground truth is a committed fixture (`science/data/booklet-answer-keys.json`),
not the content model — `outputs/` is gitignored, so a gate reading the model
finds nothing on a fresh clone and passes having compared nothing. Where the
model IS present the keys are re-derived and the fixture must still match.

```bash
node tools/check-science-answer-keys.mjs --write-fixture   # after extract:science-content
```

**Coverage is recorded and may not fall.** 480 of 636 questions are covered;
the fixture stores that as `minimumCovered` and the gate fails if it drops. A
parser that stops recognising one pack's key layout otherwise takes a whole
unit out of the comparison while the gate still prints ✓ — which is exactly how
156 questions can sit unchecked behind a green tick. Coverage is a number that
only goes up.

The 156 uncovered are 13 units, all-or-nothing per unit, and 6 of them are
**Stage 1, which ships no Practice booklet at all** (Activities, Experiments and
Lesson only — and no Reference, so no glossary either). Those have no booklet
key to check against and never will.

The packs write keys five ways — a 3-column table, a whole section packed into
one cell, and three paragraph forms — and one gives the key run the **same
section name as the questions**. Two traps worth keeping:

- **Splitting keys from questions by section name does not work.** The key
  sections are "Section A Answers" (no "Key" in the name) while the QUESTION
  section is "Section A: Choose the Right Answer" — matching on "answer" swaps
  the two. Position works, but only anchored to a question first: one pack
  titles its whole document "Practice Questions and Answer Keys", so an
  unanchored boundary lands at block 1 and swallows the unit.
- **A letter regex must require its bracket.** Allowing a bare `[a-e]` ate the
  first character of every answer starting with one — "clear glass" became
  "lear glass" and read as a mismatch against a correct key.

**`check-science-cambridge-objectives.mjs`** checks the mapping nothing was
checking. Beyond "the code exists in this stage", it compares the objective
**text** stored beside each code against the framework: a code stays valid
while the text beside it goes stale, and the text is what a teacher reads. It
also prints per-stage coverage, so a stage mapped to a fraction of its
objectives is visible rather than passing as "all codes valid" — Stage 8
currently references 26 of 70, Stage 4 18 of 34.

### Reviewed Science scripts

Narration scripts are reviewed in a workbook, not in the repo: `export-ehel-science-scripts.py` flattens every learner-facing line into one sheet per grade, and the reviewed file comes back from OneDrive. Those corrections cannot be hand-applied to `science/grade-*/data/` (generated), so they live in `science/data/script-review.json` and the builder lays them over every rebuild:

```bash
python tools/apply-ehel-science-script-review.py --workbook <reviewed.xlsx>   # --dry to preview
npm run build:science && npm run check:science
```

The apply step **merges** into the existing override file. It finds edits by diffing the workbook against the content on disk, which already carries any earlier review — so a re-run adds newly resolved rows instead of shrinking the file to just those. It also proves its parser on every row against the real JSON before trusting it on an edit, and refuses to apply half of an answer/options pair. Rows it reports as skipped need a human; they are not silently dropped.

### Science narration audio

`generate-ehel-science-audio.js` pre-renders each Listen button to `media/audio/tts/<cyrb53(text)>.mp3`. The hash is over the button's exact text, so the generator's strings must match `science/shared/course-ui.js` character for character — otherwise the app requests a file that was never written, silently falls back to the paid runtime endpoint, and the clip is money spent on a file nobody serves. `check:science` gates this via `check-ehel-audio-coverage.mjs`, which fails when a Listen button appears that no generator category reproduces, when a template drifts, or when the two copies of `cyrb53` diverge. Run the generator with `--dry` first; it reports characters, and ElevenLabs bills per character.

**`tools/lib/ehel-<subject>-narration.js` is the one definition** of what a course narrates and what each clip is called (`ehel-science-narration.js`, `ehel-math-narration.js`, `ehel-global-perspectives-narration.js`; the hash itself lives in `ehel-narration-hash.js`). Three tools must agree exactly and used to hold drifting copies — the generator (what to buy), `upload-media-to-bunny.js` (where each clip belongs in the deploy tree) and `prune-ehel-course-audio.mjs` (what nothing can reach). Change narrated text there, never in a copy.

Mathematics works the same way and is gated by `check:math`. The two courses share a UI, so they share the button shapes; Mathematics simply has no vocabulary word-cards.
